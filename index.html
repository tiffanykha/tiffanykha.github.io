  <h2> About </h2>
  <p> I'm currently working in Strategic Finance at Uber, and prior to that, I dabbled in investment banking at JPM, co-founded and worked on a wellness startup for a while, and played around with Bose-Einstein condensates. Prior to that, I graduated from Amherst College ('17). </p>
  <p> I've been re-exploring my artistic roots during quarantine, with some pieces I made featured here. You can usually find me in the outdoors trying to plan my next adventure. </p>
