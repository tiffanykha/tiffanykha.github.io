  <h2> About </h2>
  <p> I am currently enrolled in my MBA at the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania. I spent the past few years in various roles across finance and tech - most recently as a growth investor at a SPAC sponsor, on the Strategic Finance team at Uber, and started my career in investment banking at JP Morgan. I studied Physics at Amherst College and got to work with Bose-Einstein condensates. </p>
  <p> This site features more of my artistic pursuits, hope you enjoy browsing. f</p>
